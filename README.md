# Fetch-Rewards-Data-Analyst-Take-Home

In this exercise you will:

Demonstrate how you reason about data and how you communicate your understanding of a specific data set to others.

Requirements:

The exercise must be committed to a git repository and the link must be provided to the recruiter. Emailed files will not be reviewed.

Tips:

Communicate your thoughts in each section. Code should be commented. Findings and conclusions should be written down and shared.
Share assumptions you are making.
Exercise:

First: explore the data

Review the unstructured csv files and answer the following questions with code that supports your conclusions:

Are there any data quality issues present?
Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?
We recommend using SQL or python and data visualization to examine the data.

Second: provide SQL queries

Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.

Closed-ended questions:

What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?
Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.

Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?
Third: communicate with stakeholders

Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:

Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data
One interesting trend in the data
Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight
Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues
